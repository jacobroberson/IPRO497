# IPro 497 – Product Direction Document

## Problem statement

**IIT students waste a lot of their time finding an optimal studying space as most of them do not know where the study spots are on campus, they do not like certain areas on campus and/or some spaces do not have resources for the students.**

**IIT students do not like overcrowded study spaces. Overcrowded study spaces do not promote quality study time and result in students wasting time and not being their most efficient due to distractions and the noise around them.**

Please provide two problem statements. They are the same problem but take two passes at it.

## Top Two to Three Scenarios

### Scenario #1 (example)

Our hero us Bob is a busy student and wants to maximize his time to study and have fun, but also needs to have clean clothes to wear. When Bob heads to the dorm laundry he sees there is a sign and QR code for laundry minion. He downloads the laundry minion app and scans the QR code for the washing machine. He adds funds to laundry minion and uses the app to pay for the load from his phone and start the washer. Bob heads back to study location and get notifications when his laundry is 10 minutes, 5 minutes and finally one minute from done. No more finding his clothes strew all over the place or standing around waiting for loads to finish.

### Scenario #2 (example)

Bob pops his clothes in the dry and scans the dryer QR code with Laundry minion. He adds funds to his laundry minion card and pays for the dryer. Laundry minion tells him and when his clothes are 10 minutes, 5 minutes and 1 minute and tells IF the clothes are dry. If they are not dry, Bob can remotely add more dryer cycles to dry his clothes. No more finding his clothes strew all over the place or standing around waiting for loads to finish.

### Your Scenario #1

Bob is a commuting student and is trying to find a spot to study for his quiz this evening at IIT. Bob wanders around the campus, looking for his favorite spot to study but unfortunately, it already has been taken up by some students who have a racket going on. Bob learns and uses our app to reserve his study spot in the Pritzker building for the next day. Bob shows up to his spot the next day and finds that it is empty for him and he studies in his \*natural habitat\*. He also ends up scoring the highest in his class.

### Your Scenario #2

Alice is a student who lives on campus and has a \*not-so-quiet\* roommate. She likes to study in peace and somewhere with ambient lighting. She needs to find a new space outside of her dorm so that she can study and get on that dean&#39;s list. She is also a freshman and doesn&#39;t want to wander around campus and \*experiment\* with new study spots and ultimately waste her time. She goes on our webapp and looks at the reviews/ratings and pictures of some of the listings for study spots on campus. She selects a table in the Kaplan building and reserves it on the app. She studies comfortably without having to worry about her roommate making a racket.

### Your Scenario #3

Joe is a student that suffers attention issues and as a result needs a quiet place when he wishes to study. As much as he tries to be proactive and find a quiet place to study, Joe consistently finds that different areas around campus are busy and noisy at different times and he never seems to figure out the pattern to go to a quiet study spot when he needs to. Using our application however, Joe is able to see a map of study spaces people already have reserved/are occupying so that he can more confidently find a quiet place to study quickly.
